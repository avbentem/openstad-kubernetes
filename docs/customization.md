### Using a public IP address

If your cluster has a public IP address but you do not have an IP address available you can use xip.io.


### Using a private IP address

On your own machine you need something publically available to make DNS work and to ensure that you can request HTTPS.
There is a tunnel service available for developers that can supply this.
